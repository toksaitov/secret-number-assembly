# Secret

Clone this repository to the `auca.space` course server. Inside the repository, compile the code with `make` and run the code with `./secret`. Instead of `0.00`, your program must generate exactly the same number produced by the program from the previous task mentioned in the task form. To achieve this, recreate the `throw_random_points_into_circle` function from the previous question in the task form in x86-64 assembly under the TODO comment found in `assembly.x86-64.s`.
